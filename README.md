## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview

Australis is a cosmetics company that maintains an active presence on Facebook. To help the marketing team make dataâ€‘driven decisions, we created a Powerâ€¯BI dashboard that:

- Summarizes engagement by post **type** (link, photo, status, video) over time  
- Calculates **average** likes, comments, shares and overall engagement  
- Identifies the **best times** (weekday + time of day) to post  
- Visualizes **top comments** and a **word cloud** of customersâ€™ most used words  
- Highlights **monthly** engagement trends
